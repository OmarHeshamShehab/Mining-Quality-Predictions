Applying the following algorithms on this dataset:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- ANN to perform Linear Regression It provides an overview of the dataset and includes several models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Random Forests to evaluate and predict outcomes based on the mining data.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Mining-Quality-Predictions-main
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (Python version 3.7 or above is recommended).

## Dependencies
- Ensure you have all the required libraries installed. You can use the `Version checker.py` script to verify the environment versions.

## Usage
- Open the relevant notebooks to explore and run the models (`ANN.ipynb`, `Decission Tree.ipynb`, etc.).
- You can use `Dataset Overview.ipynb` to understand the features and properties of the data.
