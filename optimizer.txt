Let's break down the parameters:

learning_rate: This is how much the model should adjust its weights during training. A higher learning rate means bigger adjustments.

beta_1 and beta_2: These are parameters that control the decay rates of two moving averages. They help Adam adapt to the geometry of the loss function.

epsilon: This is a small number added to prevent division by zero and to ensure numerical stability in the calculations.

amsgrad: This is a boolean (True/False) parameter that determines whether to use the "AMSGrad" variant of the Adam optimizer. If set to True, it modifies the update rule for the moving average of squared gradients.

So, in simple terms, this code is configuring the Adam optimizer with specific settings for how fast the model should learn (learning_rate), how it should adapt to the data
 (beta_1 and beta_2), and some numerical stability considerations (epsilon and amsgrad).
